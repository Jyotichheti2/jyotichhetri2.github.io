# Project: Financial Services Risk Register & Prioritization

## Project Overview
In this project, I developed a comprehensive Risk Register for a regional bank environment. I identified critical assets, analyzed potential threat vectors—including Business Email Compromise (BEC) and supply chain disruptions—and utilized a risk matrix to prioritize remediation efforts based on likelihood and severity.

## Risk Assessment Framework
Following standard GRC practices, I evaluated risks based on a 1-3 scale for both likelihood and impact severity to calculate an overall Priority Score.

### Key Risks Identified:
* **Business Email Compromise (BEC):** Identified as a high-priority risk (Score: 6) where employees could be manipulated into sharing confidential data.
* **Physical Security:** Highlighted the risk of theft due to unsecured physical assets (Score: 6).
* **Data Integrity:** Analyzed the impact of poorly encrypted user databases and publicly accessible financial records.
* **Supply Chain:** Evaluated the likelihood of service disruptions due to natural disasters or delivery delays.

## Technical Skills & Concepts
* **Risk Quantification:** Calculating priority levels using the formula (Likelihood x Impact Severity).
* **Threat Identification:** Distinguishing between internal vulnerabilities (unlocked safes, poor encryption) and external threats (BEC, natural disasters).
* **Compliance Awareness:** Addressing strict financial regulations and Federal Reserve requirements for data and fund security.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used
* **GRC Fundamentals:** Risk identification, assessment, and prioritization.
* **Business Impact Analysis:** Understanding how security events affect operational environments and customer bases.
* **Strategic Planning:** Using a Risk Matrix to guide organizational security investments.

## Impact
By quantifying these risks, I provided a clear roadmap for the bank to address the most critical vulnerabilities first. This structured approach ensures that resources are allocated efficiently to protect both customer funds and organizational reputation.
