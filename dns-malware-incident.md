# Project: Security Incident Report – Brute Force & DNS Redirection

## Project Overview
In this incident response simulation, I investigated a sophisticated attack where an unauthorized user gained system access through a brute force attack. I documented the subsequent DNS manipulation used to redirect legitimate traffic to a malicious site and provided remediation strategies to secure the authentication process.

## Incident Analysis
### 1. Initial Access & Escalation
* **Attack Vector:** Brute Force. The attacker attempted multiple logins using various authentication keys until access was granted.
* **System Impact:** Once inside, the attacker altered administrative settings to gain control over the environment.

### 2. Network Manipulation (DNS & TCP/IP)
* **Protocol Level:** Transport Layer (TCP/IP).
* **Technique:** The attacker manipulated the DNS source to redirect customers to a fraudulent location.
* **Malware Distribution:** A malicious executable was planted on the fake website to compromise visiting users.

## Response & Remediation
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Recommended implementing MFA to neutralize the effectiveness of brute force attempts.
* **Access Management:** Advised on regular system updates and the immediate revocation of credentials for former employees to prevent unauthorized persistence.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used
* **Incident Documentation:** Structured reporting of attack phases (Identification, Documentation, Remediation).
* **Network Fundamentals:** Understanding TCP/IP and DNS redirection vulnerabilities.
* **Security Controls:** Implementing MFA and robust account management policies.
