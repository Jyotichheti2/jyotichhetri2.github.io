# Controls & Compliance Audit – Botium Toys  

As part of my **Foundations of Cybersecurity (Coursera)** coursework, I completed a **controls and compliance checklist** for Botium Toys, a fictional company. This project demonstrates my ability to assess missing security controls, evaluate compliance with industry standards, and provide actionable recommendations to strengthen an organization’s security posture.

## ✅ Controls Checklist  

| Control Item                                | Current Status | Notes/Recommendations |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Least Privilege                             | ❌ Not in place | Enforce access control based on role. |
| Separation of Duties                        | ❌ Not in place | Reduce insider threats by separating responsibilities. |
| Password Policies                           | ⚠️ Weak        | Enforce complexity and rotation requirements. |
| Password Management System                  | ❌ Missing      | Implement for secure, centralized account handling. |
| Encryption of PII/SPII                      | ❌ Missing      | Encrypt and classify sensitive customer data. |
| Intrusion Detection System (IDS)            | ❌ Missing      | Deploy and schedule routine monitoring. |
| Backups                                     | ❌ Incomplete   | Establish regular, tested backups. |
| Disaster Recovery Plan                      | ❌ Missing      | Develop and maintain DR procedures. |
| Antivirus Software                          | ✅ Implemented  | Maintain updates and monitoring. |
