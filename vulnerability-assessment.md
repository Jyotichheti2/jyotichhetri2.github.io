# Project: Vulnerability Assessment & Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involved conducting a formal vulnerability assessment for a server environment hosting a MySQL database on Linux. Following the **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1** framework, I analyzed threat sources, evaluated the likelihood and severity of potential incidents, and developed a comprehensive remediation strategy to protect sensitive organizational data.

## System Configuration
* **Operating System:** Linux (Latest Version)
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Memory:** 128GB RAM
* **Security Protocols:** SSL/TLS Encrypted Connections

## Risk Assessment Matrix
I evaluated various threat sources and events based on their likelihood and severity (Scale 1-3):

| Threat Source | Threat Event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk Level |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **APT (Advanced Persistent Threat)** | Targeted network sniffer installation | 3 | 3 | 3 (High) |
| **Hacker** | Session eavesdropping and message relay (MITM) | 2 | 3 | 3 (High) |
| **Competitor** | Data exfiltration of sensitive information | 1 | 3 | 3 (High) |

## Remediation Strategy
To mitigate the identified risks, I proposed the following security enhancements:

1.  **Identity & Access Management (IAM):** Implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege.
2.  **Network Security:** Transitioning from SSL to **TLS** for all data-in-motion to ensure stronger encryption.
3.  **Access Filtering:** Implementing **IP allow-listing** to restrict database connections exclusively to authorized corporate office ranges.
4.  **Continuous Auditing:** Establishing authentication and authorization auditing mechanisms to monitor for unauthorized access attempts.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used
* **Frameworks:** NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 (Risk Management Framework).
* **Risk Analysis:** Threat modeling, impact assessment, and risk prioritization.
* **Technical Remediation:** TLS configuration, IP filtering, and IAM best practices.

## Impact
This assessment provided a clear roadmap for securing high-value database assets. By identifying high-risk vulnerabilities like session eavesdropping, the organization was able to prioritize the implementation of TLS and IP allow-listing, significantly reducing the attack surface.
